Combining the power of SwiftUI and RealityKit can open up incredible possibilities for creating immersive augmented reality experiences. In this article, we’ll explore how to convert a SwiftUI view to a RealityKit object texture using the sample code provided. We’ll cover the necessary steps, from setting up the environment to handling user interactions and applying textures to 3D objects.
